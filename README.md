# JobsCRM
This Power Apps application allows users to keep track of their job applications. Users can log details about each job they have applied for. The app provides an organized way to monitor the progress of job applications.

Unfortunately, this application is only accessible within the universityâ€™s Power Apps environment. However, I have uploaded a video demonstrating how the app works.

Additionally, you can explore the UI-related code used in this application.
